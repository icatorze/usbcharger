# USB Charger 
**USB charger with 4 outputs of 1A each for 12V car output**

Some years ago I designed this power source to charge 4 cell phone at once, each output can driver 1A max.

Input voltage can vary from 7V until 40V DC, preferebly regulated, but can run with a poor regulated source. 

Input has a protection circuit that resists to car crank induced voltages, when batery release ignition motor and passes to run using 
alternator.

An interesting detail is a 200 ohms resistor between USB signal lines D+ and D-. This resistor tells do cell phone to take as much energy it can.

It is not a "Turbo" charger, but it safely charge my Androids and 'Mister Jobs' phones.

Feel free to copy it, use it, sell it, of course has no warranty of any kind. 


# Details
